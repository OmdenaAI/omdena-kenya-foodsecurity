265,82,Senegal,2020-08-11,0,No hotspot,"Rainfall in August has been below-average in central and eastern parts of the country, particularly in Matam, Satin-Louis, Louga and Tambacounda. However, thanks to above-average rainfall so far in July, there is no evidence about major impact on vegetation conditions, which remains near average according to remote sensing indices and water satisfaction index that is still close to 100%.",3,1,3
346,82,Senegal,2020-07-11,0,No hotspot,"Planting of the main season millet and sorghum crop is progressing normally in the country thanks to good cumulative rainfall that has benefited cropland planting and pasture regeneration.   Dry spells in the south-west (i.e. Matam) and central Senegal have been registered at the start of the season that have led to below-average vegetation conditions in some parts, according to remote sensing indices (i.e. NDVI). Nevertheless, the second dekad of July has been followed by heavy rains (more than 70 mm) that favoured agricultural activities despite localized floods. Moreover, weather forecast indicates a likelihood of above-average rains in the following weeks ([https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/people/shrad/SubX/Plots/Archive/Latest/Global/Monthly_pr_sfc_Global.png]SubX.",8,4,9

832,82,Senegal,2019-11-11,0,No hotspot,"Harvest of the 2019 season is completed and cereal production is estimated at about 2,768,405, a 27 percent more than the five-year average but a 4 percent below that of the 2018 level (-4%) ([http://www.cilss.int/index.php/2019/11/29/avis-sur-les-perspectives-agricoles-et-alimentaires-2019-2020-au-sahel-et-en-afrique-de-louest/]PREGEC, 25 November 2019.  Despite a delay in the onset and a poor distribution of rain at the beginning of the season, vegetation has recovered due to near to average rains since mid-August and an extension of the season in early October that made up for early season dryness. However, pastoral conditions have been more affected by high temperatures and periods of dry spells and biomass condition remains a concern in northern and central parts of Senegal, particularly in Matam and Podor.",2,2,2
913,82,Senegal,2019-10-11,1,Hotspot,"Harvesting of the 2019 coarse grain crops (maize, millet and sorghum) is ongoing and production is estimated average, in spite of a delayed start of rains coupled with irregular rainfall, high temperatures and periods of dry spells in Northern and Central parts of Senegal. The negative impact of drought have been mitigated by a farmer support program applied by the Government. Moreover, weather conditions have improved at the end of the season due to close to average rainfall received since September that has partly reduced the negative effect of water deficits.   Pastoral conditions are negatively affected by a consecutive unfavorable rainy season that has led to well-below average biomass production with cumulated NDVI deficits observed in the northern regions, particularly in Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Kolack, Diourbel and Kaffrine.

994,82,Senegal,2019-09-11,1,Hotspot,"Despite improved rainfall between end of August and mid-September across agricultural areas in central and western parts of the country, crop conditions remain below-average. The insufficient rains at the start of the cropping season delayed planting activities of coarse grains and the seasonal cumulative rainfall remains 10-20% below-average. Continuation of the rains in the following weeks is needed to allow crops to reach full maturity, although the degree of crop recovery from the long drought is not clear. Pastoral conditions in the northern and central parts of the country are also showing below-average conditions, despite some rainfall received since the end of August. Grassland conditions in northern Senegal are at the lowest level of biomass production in the last 20 years ([http://www.fao.org/3/ca6057en/ca6057en.pdf] Crop Prospects and Food Situation-FAO. The limited rainfall received from the start of the season until mid-August coupled with above-average temperatures in some areas (e.g. 2-3o C in Matam from June until mid-August) are lowering pastoral vegetation productivity, threatening to negatively impact livestock productivity, a key sector of food security in the area.",14,9,14
1075,82,Senegal,2019-08-11,1,Hotspot,"Planting in Senegal is delayed by over one month and the country has experienced only limited rainfall until mid August (below 50% of normal in the north and north/east). Only in the last dekad of August there has been improved rain in the central and western parts of the country, but it is unclear to what degree crops will be able to recover after the long dry period. Below average yields in the majority of the country are likely and local newspapers do not exclude a strong deterioration of the food security situation. Pastoral vegetation does also appear exceptionally dry and rapid vegetation depletion can be expected if rainfall does not improve quickly.  see for example: [http://www.rewmi.com/2019/08/23/retard-pluviometrique-les-cultures-se-meurent-la-famine-se-precise/]http://www.rewmi.com/2019/08/23/retard-pluviometrique-les-cultures-se-meurent-la-famine-se-precise/</a>",14,9,14
